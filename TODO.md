# Starter template backlog (temporary)

Ideas for things every project built from this template is likely to need.
Work through them one at a time (each usually starts with `/feature`), tick them off, and delete this file when it's empty.

## Do first
- [ ] **"Make it mine" init script.** e.g. `task init -- --module github.com/you/app --name "Acme"`. It should:
  - rename the Go module, the "Starter" brand, the binaries and the Docker image;
  - optionally remove the sample `Item` domain.
- [ ] **"Rename project" script** based on the init script above. Allows for easy rebranding or changing from an initial "working title" later in development. Unlike the init script, it does not get deleted after running.
- [ ] **SQL storage adapter + migrations** (SQLite first). It must implement `ports.ItemRepository` and pass `storagetest.RunItemRepositoryContract`. It lifts the jsonfile adapter's single-instance limit (ADR 0003).
- [ ] **Authentication behind a port.** An `Authenticator` port with a simple session or OIDC adapter, wired through the REST API, the SPA, and the CLI's `--server` mode. Currently listed in SPEC.md §6 "Out of scope".
- [ ] **Phone-width SPA layout.** The sidebar is a fixed `w-60`, so the app breaks on phones. Add a collapsible sidebar or bottom navigation, and check it in all three styles and both themes.

## Operability
- [ ] **Logging, metrics and traces:**
  - structured `slog` logs with a request ID on every request;
  - a `/metrics` endpoint;
  - optional OpenTelemetry tracing.
- [ ] **Security basics:**
  - security headers and a CSP on the server;
  - request size limits and rate limiting on the API;
  - `govulncheck` and `pnpm audit` in CI.
- [ ] **Release automation:** GoReleaser (or similar), a changelog convention, and Renovate or Dependabot.

## API and data conventions
- [ ] **Pagination, sorting and filtering on list endpoints**, cursor-based. `GET /items` currently returns everything.
- [ ] **Concurrent-edit protection:** a `version` field or ETag on updates, so concurrent edits don't silently overwrite each other.
- [ ] **Seed data:** `task dev:seed` for realistic local data.

## Front-end polish
- [ ] **No flash of the wrong theme or style:** a tiny inline script in `web/index.html` that applies both before React loads.
- [ ] **Shared feedback patterns:** toasts, an error boundary and a proper 404 page.
- [ ] **Automated accessibility checks:** axe in the Playwright e2e tests, across every style × theme.

## Maybe (depends on the products built from it)
- [ ] Translations (i18n)
- [ ] Background jobs or domain events (outbox pattern)
- [ ] Audit log (who changed what, and when)

## Other
- [ ] Generate a new TODO.md file that lives in the template permanently. It's purpose is to list out tasks for a new project that a developer should start with when using this template, including things like running the `init` script, defining the vision in an appropriate place for Claude to reference, and swapping out the mockups for new styles, among others. Once these initial tasks are complete, the TODO.md file can stick around as a place to keep new ideas for the application that have yet to be implemented. Add a note to CLAUDE.md that feature and bugfix ideas live here.
